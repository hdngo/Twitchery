Things to implement:

Core features/functionality:
Have the user input from the search bar be passed in to the XHR request URL.
	Possible steps: 
	-Declare a variable that represents the base URL without any additional parameters
	-Retrieve value from search bar input field
	-Append the value to the base URL variable appropriately
	-Make request

Based on the number of results returned from the search, manage pagination of the results.
	Possible steps:
	-Retrieve response from XHR
	-Store the response in a variable
	-Look at the total number of results
	-Choose number of results to display per page (fixed for now)
	-Divide total number of results by chosen number of results to display per page (so we know if there'll be 8 pages, 10 pages, etc)
	-Create a nested/2d array that stores the chosen number of results per page into a single array; a single array represents a page
	 --Alternatively, create a JSON object that has properties such as page 1, page 2, etc. are assigned an array value containing X number of results
	-Have a previous/next results page button, where the buttons will point to the current page number value +/- 1
	-Refresh results content div to show appropriate results

Render an image thumbnail that previews the stream, along with the stream display name, game name, number of viewers, and stream description.
Possible steps:
	-For each result object create a div
	-Within each div, have one div floated left to contain the thumbnail 
	-Have another div to contain general information about the stream
	*Have images and links point to actual stream links
